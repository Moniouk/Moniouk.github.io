                    The preparation and consumption of food and the embedded ties to nostalgia and sensory memories. The process of cooking is also one that is entrenched within our senses. Specifically, sense memories which form an integral part of each and every one of our autobiographical recollections.

                <div class="main bodycopy foreword">
                The Cookbook of Memories explores the intersection between food cultures, sense memories and digital technology. Thus, the act of food preparation and consumption is one that is entrenched within our instinctual habits as living organisms. It is a part of our history, identity, genetics and culture. Yet, if cooking and food consumption is deeply rooted with our senses, how do we depict these tactile sensory experiences through technology?
    
                </div> 
    
                <div class="main bodycopy foreword second">
                    We can't taste, touch, smell or hear the act of cooking/consumption of food when we read a recipe online. So how does one represent these sensory experiences? The Cookbook of Memories aims to address, explore and deconstruct the cooking process by dismantling the act of cooking itself through sound and visual association. The sounds we hear manifest a sense of nostalgia within us and perhaps that is the role of memory within food creation. Hence, there is a strong relationship between food and digital culture. Where food is sustenance in the most primal sense of the term, digital culture offers a different kind of nourishment; it provides the contemporary infrastructure through which food is increasingly communicated and fought over.

                    1. THE MANY FACES OF BREAD.
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    There are three things that have long fascinated me about <span style="background-color: black; color:  #edebd8;" class="crunch cursor">Bread.</span> Firstly: it is everywhere.Every place, every culture has its own bread, whether made from barley, rice, corn, spelt, rye, or teff, fermented or not, flat or leavened, brown, yellow, or white, often round, fried, boiled, or cooked in all kinds of ovens. Some breads taste slightly of ashes or oil, while others can be acidic or sweet. Sometimes bread is more than just the combination of flour and water; it might have sourdough, salt, sugar, or seeds.  It has many names: <span style="font-weight:bold;">chapati, injera, pita, tortilla, baozi, ugali, and many more.</span> Many Western bread-lovers might contend that some of these examples shouldn’t even be called “bread,” but I take a more expansive view. For me, bread is what daily human meals have centered around since the species started to harvest cereals, the food that we carried with us when we were nomadic because it lasts for many weeks in a bundle. <div class="notes breadonelink cursor">
                        <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span>
                    </div> 
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    The second thing that comes to my mind when I think of bread is “company.” Con-panis. With-bread. In its older usage, the word draws from companio in Latin, literally “one who eats bread with you.” If bread is essential to what humans eat, it thus sits at the center of social interactions. When we share it, with humans and nonhumans alike (think of your dog, or ducks at the park), it signals love, bonding, companionship. Making and eating bread is a collective human experience. <div class="notes breadonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">  
                    Lastly is the role that bread has played in social and political change. In Ancient Rome, emperors used panem et cicenses (bread and games) to keep the people happy and disciplined. Historically, so long as the otherwise exploited could put bread on the table, relative stability was ensured. But once the price of cereals rose, many took to the streets. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">This has of course continued to play out in more recent history. Examples include the Flour War (April–May 1775) in the lead-up to the French Revolution,</span> revolts across the entire Italian Peninsula following the 1869 grist (ground grain) tax, or the post-2008 spike in grain prices at the dawn of the Arab Spring, just to name a few. <div class="notes breadonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    In short, bread leads to <span style="font-weight:bold;">revolution.</span> There is much to be said about that historical correlation, but personally I’m more fascinated by the courage of people who defend their access to a good loaf. Because, as far as I’m concerned, access to a good loaf is essential to human dignity. <div class="notes breadonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span> </div>

                    2. THE MANY DEATHS OF ARTISANAL BREAD.
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    I started making bread at home when my home was no longer France, in places where bakeries were overpriced and not that good. Later, when I lived at a squatted farm in Tuscany, I began to bake artisanal bread to sell at markets of local producers. This is when I learned that sourdough is not all that complicated and that its active cultures—living beings—are what make it so alluring. <span style="font-weight:bold;">I’ve slowly tamed bread and it’s slowly taming me</span> , just like Le Petit Prince tames the fox and vice versa: fully respecting what the other is, bonding anytime our paths cross, embracing the fact that neither of us will own the other. It’s been a journey that has taken me across France to make, talk, and dream bread with many people. Observing the French and wider European contexts, I’ve found that the politics of bread is a proxy for talking about the broader dynamics and deficiencies of the current international food system. <div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Modern wheats were also selected for their baking strength. The higher the strength, the more resistant the gluten is when it comes into contact with water, and thus the easier it is to make leavened bread. Since <span style="background-color: black; color:  #edebd8;" class="knead cursor">kneading</span> had come to be done by big machines instead of human hands, high baking strength was necessary for producing loaves attractive to consumers. But this came at a nutritional cost: bread rich in heavy indigestible gluten is one of the reasons for the development of ubiquitous gluten intolerance today. <div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    The less bran, the poorer the flour is in fiber and minerals. To compensate for the nutritional loss from the chemically induced whitening process, the milling industry started to enrich flours with nutritional supplements and all sort of “delicious,” “healthy,” chemically produced processing aids, which would become standard. In fact, when bread first became a <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">product,object,food,item??</span> commodity, white bread was always trendier than browner bread. It’s a class thing: <span style="font-weight:bold;"> historically, white bread was traditionally for rich people because it was thought to demonstrate the “cleanliness” and “purity” of the flour.</span> This fallacy was reproduced with industrial bread production, and so shitty industrial white flour started to flood the market. <div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="cursor quote breadcut">
                    Bread is no longer alive; it has become a machine, just like the baker. 

                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                     In bread factories, flours only need two hours to become bread, rather than the typical twenty-four. Like most of the food we consume in the West, bread became rationalized. And hyper-leavened, innutritious, high-glycemic-index white bread took over supermarket shelves. Efficiency above all else, at the cost of quality, respect, and pleasure.
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    The law established a strict definition for what it means to be <span style="font-weight:bold;">artisan</span>  baker. To claim this title, bakers have to perform the entire bread-making process from kneading to baking, using selected raw materials, at a brick and mortar establishment, and without in-process freezing. While the rest of Europe saw many of its traditional bakeries close in the face of aggressive supermarket chains, France sought to save its bakers, while also using the romantic image of the baguette (especially paired with French cheese and wine) to attract mass tourism. The campaign was successful on its surface, as 95 percent of French consumers now buy their bread from artisanal bakeries.<div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    This would be a beautiful story about successful state intervention if, twenty-five years later, I could go the artisanal bakery around the corner and eat delicious, <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">subpar? No, It was alright. Not the best tasting. Okay.</span> healthy bread. But, as is often the case with state intervention, the public was misled—including at least one disillusioned Australian blogger living in France. The story of institutionalizing “artisan” bread production in France is really the story of corporate recuperation and consolidation.This new requirement systematizes the learning of “traditional” bread making recipes that rely exclusively on chemical yeast and near-white flours. As a result, many artisan bakers wake up in the middle of the night to combine water and ready-made mixes, breathing in industrial flour and baking improvers that trigger asthma and pollute their lungs—all to make second-rate bread that does nothing for the health of those who eat it. <div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">5.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Now there is a new player in the “artisan” bread game. Let’s call it the <span style="font-weight:bold;">“bobo” (bourgeois bohemian) baker</span> “bobo” (bourgeois bohemian) baker: typically a former white-collar worker who left the corporate world in search of more meaningful work. Bobo bakers are behind the growth in organic sourdough bakeries. They are fond of greening capitalism but are sometimes blind to class and social struggle—which is one reason why they can sell a one-kilogram loaf for as much as fourteen euros in Paris. It is good bread made with good flour, and it tastes great if you can afford it. Some of these bobo bakers have themselves been exploited by even more aggressive and cynical bread entrepreneurs. <div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">6.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Another lucrative branch of “eat-healthy” capitalism is the gluten-free bread industry. What’s ironic about the gluten-free market is that it offers a solution to a problem created by food industrialization in the first place. As mentioned earlier, it is precisely the over-consumption of industrial bread (and other industrial products) that has created a huge population of people who are unable to digest it. <div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">7.</span> </div>

                    3. BREAD STRIKES BACK.
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    If you love bread but hate agribusiness and monoculturization, what are you to do? I started to find answers to this question when I got involved a year ago with a Francophone bakers’ network called the Internationale Boulangère Mobilisée (Mobilized Bakers’ International, IBM). It is not a collective; it does not have a common charter. I can only speak about my own understanding of us because this “us” is still in the making. IBM is composed of whoever wants to join—from those who bake at home, to mobile bakers with DIY wood-fired ovens, to semi-large-scale paysannes-boulangères (peasant bakers) who make bread from wheat they grow themselves and legally sell it. <div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">8.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">We all believe that bread is political </span> though we may not all agree on the exact political form it takes. We all try to integrate bread into our lifestyle, work, and relationships, if in different ways. I have found a network of companions and deep relationships—friends to call and visit and make bread with. I have grown hopeful that the seemingly little things we do can become powerful when done together. I have learned that anyone anywhere can make good bread, for everyone and not just for those who can pay. I have realized that a political loaf always tastes good, always fills the stomach with good stuff, even if it sometimes looks flat or lacks the sheen of supermarket bread. This is not because breadmaking, collective or otherwise, is by itself going to change the contemporary food system, but because together we have the power to create imaginaries of work and relationships that do not conform to the dominant paradigm of production.<div class="notes breadtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">9.</span> </div>

                    In the early hours of July 17, 2020, I had a dream I was cooking with my amma (Tamil for “mother”). We were together in my childhood home in Connecticut, making <span style="background-color: black; color:  #edebd8;" class="deepfry cursor">meen (fish) cutlets.</span>  Fish cutlets are a variation of bolinho, the deep-fried and breaded Portuguese<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> fish-and-potato croquette.</span> In Sri Lanka, meen cutlets fall into the culinary genre of “short-eats”— handheld bites prepared for entertaining guests or a quick snack on the road. <div class="notes bloodonelink cursor">

Cloudy, unmarked plastic canisters of spices and leftover loose curry leaves watch for hands and tiny spoons. The potatoes wait to be diced and boiled. Then, they anticipate being mashed together with tinned mackerel in a mixing bowl and combined with  <span style="background-color: black; color:  #edebd8;" class="mintsound cursor">finely chopped curry leaves and green chilies.</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"> onion and mustard seed, cumin seed, lime juice, salt, black pepper, chili, and curry powder.</span> In the foreground, a pile of Progresso Italian-style breadcrumbs is spread out over two layers of an old Tamil or English newspaper that my appa (father) has long since finished reading.

Later, as a six-, seven-, and eight-year-old, if I was lucky, I would be allowed to help her dip <span style="font-weight:bold;">two or three of the small, molded balls of cooked fish and potatoes into a bowl of egg yolk to coat them, and then roll them gently over the small hills of breadcrumbs.</span>  She would place the raw, breaded cutlets onto a newspaper-lined plate, which she would then bring out to the back deck to fry. <div class="notes bloodonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span> </div>

After easing them down, she would let the boiling liquid saturate their insides and turn their skins to a warm golden brown. After a minute or two she would retrieve them, one to three at a time, and place them on the newspaper, careful not to break their delicate molds. <div class="notes bloodonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span> </div>

                    Watching my amma make meen cutlets—and eating them hot out of the fryer on our cold, Connecticut deck while the ink of Tamil and English scripts bled into their makings—formed my only childhood memories about a Sri Lanka marked by stability and constancy. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"> From 1983 to 2009, the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fought battles over their competing, insatiable dreams of ethno-nationalist control.</span>  Their warring desires were unleashed at the expense of civilians, with the violence disproportionately devastating the lives of Sri Lanka’s Tamil and Muslim minorities. <div class="notes bloodtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span> </div>

                     I took a red-eye from San Francisco to Connecticut on day ten, and when I greeted my mother outside their house with my luggage in hand, she immediately told me to come inside and have a wash after the flight. I told her that I could not because she had Covid, and she became frustrated that I had even travelled to see her. In her words, <span style="font-weight:bold;">“What is the point of you coming all the way here if you can’t even come inside and eat?”</span>  I didn’t have a good response. She was right; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> I felt inconsolably helpless.</span>  What good could I possibly do for her if I could not even enter her house to eat? <div class="notes bloodtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span> </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Eventually, because it was unseasonably warm for early November, she joined me on the deck and brought out some <span style="font-weight:bold;">broken-up pomegranate</span>, telling me that it was the only thing she felt like eating. I gave her some coconut water and told her that she needed to drink. We sat there in distant patches of the brisk sun, drinking coconut water and eating pomegranate seeds until she got tired and went inside to nap. <div class="notes bloodtwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span> </div>

She could not remember how to get there. I got out of the car and told her that it was okay. She has not driven since. When I left Connecticut,  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> she blew me a kiss</span> from the threshold of the garage door and asked me if I was coming home for Christmas.

                    When I found out I was pregnant a month and half after leaving Connecticut, I chose not to tell my amma, who was still recovering from her brain fog. Instead, I would talk to her about cooking and her childhood. <span style="font-weight:bold;">I asked for her cutlet recipe again and again but did not mention that I could not eat tinned mackerel because of the mercury coursing through their bodies.</span>  She told me about her own amma’s cutlets—about how, when she was thirteen years old, her mother taught her how to make them. If there were no breadcrumbs to buy in Kalmunai town, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> her mother would put out pieces of bread in the hot sun and dry them out, smashing them to a crisp. They cooked cutlets with fresh fish back then.</span>  Every day, her father would bring home fresh fish caught by fishers from Kalmunai Beach, about a mile or so from their house. Other days he would bring home <span style="font-weight:bold;">kanivai (cuttlefish) and nandu (crab)</span> , and her mother would cook them for her and her older brothers. On weekends the children would walk their two dogs to Kalmunai Beach. Other days, when not in school at Carmel Convent for girls, my mother would help her amma care for the baby chickens they were keeping in a small incubator on the dining room table: black, brown, white lagoons, and another variety called Plymouth, as my amma’s elder brother would later fill in.<div class="notes bloodthreelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span> </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    On December 22, 1964, when my mother was seventeen years old, a cyclone devastated <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Kalmunai, Batticaloa, Mannar, Trincomalee, and other coastal areas in the north and east of Sri Lanka </span>, then called  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Ceylon.</span> She recalled how the storm felled all the coconut trees along the water. With the groves downed, they could see the coastline clearly from a mile away. The stormwater had come up to the steps of their house, but not inside. In that sense they were spared, but so many neighbors in their town and in nearby villages lost their lives and homes. Later, she would tell my niece and sister how her amma and appa had opened their home to those who had been displaced by the damage. <div class="notes bloodthreelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span> </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    After seeing a heartbeat on a late January ultrasound two days after my fortieth birthday, I told my amma and appa that I was expecting. Two weeks later, on my amma’s seventy-fourth birthday, it was confirmed that I was miscarrying. As I lay alone in the emergency room, bleeding on a different ultrasound table, I thought of how, when I was in grade school, I had lain next to my amma in bed as she recovered from her hysterectomy. She, like me now, had a uterus that was deemed myomatous. For years she had endured severe cramping and bleeding, and because she was done having children, her doctor recommended removing her uterus and the smooth tumors it held. The surgeon recorded the procedure and sent her home with a copy of it on VHS. Together, in her bedroom, we managed to watch it for a few minutes.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">It was the first time I had seen the insides of a body. But it would not be the last.</span>  <div class="notes bloodthreelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span> </div>

                    I also thought of a story that my mother had told me recently, in those months of brain fog before I learned that I was pregnant. She talked about the time she learned to cook  <span style="background-color: black; color:  #edebd8;" class="oilfry cursor">meen kuzhumbu (fish curry)</span>  on her own. When she was a teenager, her amma had traveled alone from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Kalmunai to Jaffna </span>, in the north, to cook and care for her older sister and their family. Her sister was recovering from her own hysterectomy. Alone in the ER, I ached for my sister, with whom I share the diagnosis of living with endometriosis and the collective experience of four endometrial ablation surgeries. I thought, let this blood flow from my womb tonight. And take with it this unending devastation. But leave behind my blood-memories and bloodlines. In my sanguinary trauma, I did not know the future and the necessary bonds they would lead to. But somehow, I knew I would need them in the months to come. Two months later, I would make my amma’s cutlets. Six months after that, I would make them again. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Each time, they tasted more and more like the ones I had eaten as a child. </span> <div class="notes bloodthreelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span> </div>

                    In July 2021, I returned to Connecticut to visit my amma and appa. There, she gave me her 1964, revised fifth-edition copy of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">[Ceylon] Daily News Cookery Book edited by Hilda Deutrom.</span>  She brought the book with her to the United States when she left Sri Lanka in 1973 and had used it throughout our childhood to make us  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">love cake, beetroot and spinach ribbon sandwiches, milk toffee, and caramel pudding.</span>  There are stains on its red cover and the binding was taped with eight clear pieces of cellotape. But the original bookmark—an ad for ““Housewife’s Choice”“ V.B.F.” Pure Creamery Butter—somehow remains affixed within its seams. The first three advertisements in the edition are for gas cookers: “Gas is your reliable assistant, loyal friend, and faithful servant. Therefore, use gas.” Towards the end of the book, I found another advertisement, for Cooks-Joy vegetable cooking oil: “No cook worth her salt will settle for less.” <div class="notes bloodfourlink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span> </div>

                    I have not made my amma’s cutlets since September 2021. But I think about them often as the ink from my childhood continues to haunt my blood. Since 2019, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sri Lanka’s president, Gotabaya Rajapakse, along with his now former prime minister brother, Mahinda Rajapakse (who also used to be president), have steeped the country’s civilians in an unrecoverable economic crisis through a series of longstanding policies and practices of militarization, ethno-nationalist violence, and corruption. </span>  Food prices have inflated to unmanageable heights, life-saving medicines and medical equipment are no longer available, and imported gas, diesel, and petrol for cooking, transportation, and daily life are docked on cargo ships off the island’s coast. The goods remain unloaded; there are no dollars in the country to pay for them. Fishers, who would have caught the kind of fresh fish that my amma and her amma cooked at home, cannot go out to sea because there is no diesel for their trawlers.<div class="notes bloodfourlink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span> </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">

                <div class="cursor first quote">
                    "Good cooks thrive best in the wholesome atmosphere of good homes. Conversely, domestic felicity is usually much beholden to a refined taste in what is crudely described as “feeding the brute” … A country’s culinary prowess is often an index of its domestic well-being."  <br>

Until then, I must assure myself that I and other daughters of mothers and grandmothers in Sri Lanka will make fish cutlets again. For one another, and together, in and with the fish in the sea.<span style="font-weight:bold;"> Our makings will hold traces of ink and blood.</span>  But one day, it will happen.

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;"> What does it mean to be a skillful cook?</span> Over the last several centuries, the skillful cook was arguably the one who most successfully healed the historical wounds of modernity by reconciling traditional dishes with modern techniques. Cooking, in this genre, is historical work. More recently, the skillful cook has become more of a selector who rediscovers the flavor of ingredients displaced by supermarket supply chains and industrial farming. Like Alice Waters serving a single uncut Japanese pear for dessert, cooking in this genre is less historical work than it is ecological work. <div class="notes cookonelink cursor">

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Plato gave a memorable definition of the skillful cook, as the one who knows how to find nature’s articulations, cutting delicately along its bones rather than chopping heedlessly through. </span> This passage has given rise to a long debate in western philosophy over how to be a skillful cook—of how to find the articulations of nature, or whether or not these articulations really exist. In this debate, good cooking becomes a question of how to say something true about the world. To think of the skillful cook in this sense is to acknowledge that cooking is always more than simply heating food. <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Cooks assemble the social and environmental relationships that tell us where we are in the world and how best to live there.</span> The skilled ones, in this genre, show us how to be cosmopolitan in a community whose members are not always human and not necessarily alive. In a world of broken social and ecological relations this task becomes all the more important, as the skillful cook must discover new and alternative articulations, cutting along a line that may have been invisible to us before. <div class="notes cookonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span> </div>

                    1. THE COAT AND ITS SEAMSTRESS.
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">  
                    The first time you see an Alutiiq parka it looks like an  <span style="font-weight:bold;">optical illusion.</span>  From a distance it looks heavy and dense like chiseled white marble, or a pearl oyster encrusted with sea life. From close up it becomes luminous and light with fine creases that reveal striations and layers of transparency, as if it was made from tracing paper. Unless you’re Alutiiq, it’s a fabric that looks unfamiliar to the point of being otherworldly. <div class="notes cookonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    In the language of anthropologists, it’s called a “summer gut skin parka.” It’s made by the Alutiiq people of the Aleutian archipelago, and it’s completely waterproof. According to conservationists at Harvard’s Peabody Museum, it’s impermeable from the outside, but breathes from the inside like “Gore-Tex.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each translucent horizontal band is an intestine from northern fur seal or sea lion that is dried, cured, and sewn together with other intestines.</span>  Sea mammals have long thin intestines that are a hallmark of all gut skin parkas. At specific points along the edge of each intestine, small soft feathers and human hair are sewn into the seam. The feathers are from birds that were acquired in trades, bound tightly to the garment with tough sewing thread made from the sinew of dogs. The hair is from the seamstress. <div class="notes cookonelink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    The process of making the parka begins with a kind of cooking. Alutiiq garments often contain a variety of hides harvested over many sea and terrestrial hunts. Alutiiq women take apart the seals or other sea mammals provided to them by the hunters. Using their ulu knife they  <span style="background-color: black; color:  #edebd8;" class="mintsound cursor">carefully cut,</span>  classify, and organize everything to be used either for food, building equipment, or garments. When the meat has been cut out, they get to the long, thin intestines, which are turned inside out and carefully washed. After several washing cycles, the <span style="font-weight:bold;"> intestines are then inflated like balloons by tying a knot in both ends, and dried.</span>The seamstress then waits for the blown intestines to dry or freeze, depending on which season the coat is being made. If the intestines freeze then they will become darker and more opaque. If the seamstress is making the coat in summer, the intestines don’t freeze and take on a translucent appearance. The color, translucency, and texture of the parka all derive from the specific conditions that were present at the moment it was made, making the garment a kind of material memory. <div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">5.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    The seamstress also makes the thread. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First, she twists sinew, or bits of animal tendon, into strips. Then, with her fingernails, she separates the strips into thin fibers, moistens them, rolls them between her palms, and wraps the resulting thread around a wooden bobbin.</span>  
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    Sewing is crucial work, but in this case what is being assembled is more than just a garment. Through her labor, the seamstress of this <span style="font-weight:bold;">Alutiiq parka has assembled a vast arctic ecosystem into a wearable waterproof cosmos..</span>  In this sense, it could not be more different from the petroleum-based “performance fabrics” being sold today. The material understanding of arctic environmental relations required to assemble this coat make its “performance” not one of mere impermeability, but of a vastly more sophisticated kind of permeability to the subtle differences and small anatomical gestures of non-human species that have been learned over generations of human families. This aspect of the parka makes it difficult to see as an object at all. The parka is more like a small moment excerpted from a longer process of turning the world inside out. Like the intestines the parka is made out of, the parka belongs to a larger process of inverting the artic to make it home, and this is something that the Alutiiq people are still skilled at today.<div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">6.</span> </div>

                    2. THE Q'ANAT AND ITS SURVEYOR
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    In “The Art of Paying Attention,” Tim Ingold describes something that all skillful cooks possess:<span style="text-decoration: underline;">attendere.</span>  As Ingold describes, <span style="font-weight:bold;">attendere is the act of looking closely, very closely, so close that you begin to stretch towards something, noticing things you hadn’t seen before, and being changed by what you find.</span>  It is impossible to imagine the invention of the Alutiiq parka without this kind of attendere, with its acute sensitivity to the intricate details of membrane and sinew. But how much time does attendere take? A day? A week? A lifetime? The work of the skillful cook cannot be particularly quick if it requires the kind of attendere revealed by the Alutiiq parka. However, there is a paradox in the process of paying attention that is essential to consider here. <div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Q’anats are an ancient form of hydrological infrastructure used to irrigate agricultural land and provide water to inhabitants of arid environments. Q’anats can be found in Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. The origin of the q’anat probably dates to 3,000 years ago in present day Iran, after which the technology spread to Asia through Turkey, to Europe through the Arab conquest of Spain, and to Latin America through the Spanish colonial empire. They are called “Romani” in Syria, “Kanerjing” in Western China, “Karez” in Afghanistan and Pakistan, “Galerias” in Spain and Latin America, “Falaj” in Arab countries, and “Kitthara” in Morocco. There are hundreds of thousands of kilometers of q’anats all around the world, acting like a silent global infrastructure for high quality groundwater that have largely been forgotten, abandoned, or repurposed. <div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">The first step in constructing a q’anat is to find the water, which involves digging down vertically through the mountain. This vertical well is called the mother well.</span>   Once a mother well is found, a horizontal tunnel is needed to allow the water from the mother well to flow out of the mountain via gravity. However, in order to dig this tunnel, it is not possible to simply dig horizontally out of the mountain from the mother well itself, since it’s full of water. Water makes tunneling impossible. You have to dig horizontally in through the side of the mountain to reach the bottom of the well. The question then becomes: how do you know where to begin digging, in what direction, and how far you have to dig?<div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span> </div>
                </div>


                <div class="bodycopy">
                    To know this, a very skilled surveyor is <span style="font-weight:bold;">compulsory. A must have. Absolutely fundamental.</span> required. The surveyor must understand the surface of the mountain in such intimate detail that she can identify the precise elevation that corresponds to the bottom of the mother well. Effectively, the surveyor needs to know two sides of the triangle in order to build the third, but the only side of the triangle that is known is the mother well. In order to find the third side, the hypotenuse of the triangle must be painstakingly surveyed. Then, the third side needs to be calculated in order to have a slope that is adequate to carry the water down the mountain. This slope is crucial. A q’anat could be only a few hundred meters deep but 100 kilometers long, with a margin of error of only a few centimeters per kilometer. <div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Three thousand years ago, when q’anats were first invented, the only tools available for this kind of survey were orders of magnitude less precise than those of today. But even today, with modern surveying tools, building a q’anat challenges the calibration and tolerance of digital tools. This is the basis for the paradox of q’anat design: they should not have been possible to build. Iranian surveyors used only a Mizan (telescope) and a rod. To survey with these tools, you hold the Mizan by a string, wait for it to become level, and then look straight through to find the corresponding mark on the rod. The problem of measurement for this tool, as Stathis Stiros explains, is the climate.<div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">5.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Moreover, the paradox of attendere, which becomes particularly clear in the case of q’anat design, is that the world doesn’t stay still for us. It does not pose for our photographs. <span style="font-weight:bold;">If the skillful cook must pay attention, it is always to an object in motion, whose forms are constantly refracted through its relations with other forms. The paradox, in this sense, is that the object of the skillful cook’s attention is hardly an object at all.</span>  Rather, it is always something ongoing and unfinished in the world, whose articulations are not eternal but contingent in ways that reveal an underlying animacy. For the q’anat designer, this happens as the solid and immovable mountain begins to feel ephemeral and alive after appearing at a different spatial coordinate every day for a decade. <div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">6.</span> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    For a chef in the traditional sense, to be <span style="font-weight:bold;">skillful means to cook like a seamstress</span>, recognizing that a dish is not a finished object but rather a small moment excerpted from a much larger food system, whose values reflect fundamental political beliefs about how to live as much as historical beliefs about what to eat. If there are different genres that emerge as answers to the question of how to be a skillful cook, they all require this basic consciousness of cooking as a cosmos, whose politics and ecologies form the basic structure of the world we live in. <div class="notes cooktwolink cursor"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">7.</span> </div>

                  The connection between senses and memories lies between the chasm of food preparation and consumption. It is not only nutritional value that we get from food, but the experiences, memories and interactions that come with it. We prepare food in ways that are instinctual. We reminisce the tastes, smells and flavours of times long gone. Food is the gateway to temporal displacment and position - time does not work within the realms of culinary consumption and preparation.
