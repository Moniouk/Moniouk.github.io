Specifically, sense memories which form an integral part of each and every one of our autobiographical recollections.

                    1. THE MANY FACES OF BREAD.
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    There are three things that have long fascinated me about <span style="background-color: black; color: white;">Bread.</span> Firstly: it is everywhere.Every place, every culture has its own bread, whether made from barley, rice, corn, spelt, rye, or teff, fermented or not, flat or leavened, brown, yellow, or white, often round, fried, boiled, or cooked in all kinds of ovens. Some breads taste slightly of ashes or oil, while others can be acidic or sweet. Sometimes bread is more than just the combination of flour and water; it might have sourdough, salt, sugar, or seeds.  It has many names: <span style="font-weight:bold;">chapati, injera, pita, tortilla, baozi, ugali, and many more.</span> Many Western bread-lovers might contend that some of these examples shouldn’t even be called “bread,” but I take a more expansive view. For me, bread is what daily human meals have centered around since the species started to harvest cereals, the food that we carried with us when we were nomadic because it lasts for many weeks in a bundle. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    The second thing that comes to my mind when I think of bread is “company.” Con-panis. With-bread. In its older usage, the word draws from companio in Latin, literally “one who eats bread with you.” If bread is essential to what humans eat, it thus sits at the center of social interactions. When we share it, with humans and nonhumans alike (think of your dog, or ducks at the park), it signals love, bonding, companionship. Making and eating bread is a collective human experience. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">  
                    Lastly is the role that bread has played in social and political change. In Ancient Rome, emperors used panem et cicenses (bread and games) to keep the people happy and disciplined. Historically, so long as the otherwise exploited could put bread on the table, relative stability was ensured. But once the price of cereals rose, many took to the streets. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">This has of course continued to play out in more recent history. Examples include the Flour War (April–May 1775) in the lead-up to the French Revolution,</span> revolts across the entire Italian Peninsula following the 1869 grist (ground grain) tax, or the post-2008 spike in grain prices at the dawn of the Arab Spring, just to name a few. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    In short, bread leads to <span style="font-weight:bold;">revolution.</span> There is much to be said about that historical correlation, but personally I’m more fascinated by the courage of people who defend their access to a good loaf. Because, as far as I’m concerned, access to a good loaf is essential to human dignity. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span>

                    2. THE MANY DEATHS OF ARTISANAL BREAD.
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy first">
                    I started making bread at home when my home was no longer France, in places where bakeries were overpriced and not that good. Later, when I lived at a squatted farm in Tuscany, I began to bake artisanal bread to sell at markets of local producers. This is when I learned that sourdough is not all that complicated and that its active cultures—living beings—are what make it so alluring. I’ve slowly tamed bread and it’s slowly taming me, just like Le Petit Prince tames the fox and vice versa: fully respecting what the other is, bonding anytime our paths cross, embracing the fact that neither of us will own the other. It’s been a journey that has taken me across France to make, talk, and dream bread with many people. Observing the French and wider European contexts, I’ve found that the politics of bread is a proxy for talking about the broader dynamics and deficiencies of the current international food system. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span>
                </div>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Modern wheats were also selected for their baking strength. The higher the strength, the more resistant the gluten is when it comes into contact with water, and thus the easier it is to make leavened bread. Since kneading had come to be done by big machines instead of human hands, high baking strength was necessary for producing loaves attractive to consumers. But this came at a nutritional cost: bread rich in heavy indigestible gluten is one of the reasons for the development of ubiquitous gluten intolerance today.<br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">2.</span>

                    The less bran, the poorer the flour is in fiber and minerals. To compensate for the nutritional loss from the chemically induced whitening process, the milling industry started to enrich flours with nutritional supplements and all sort of “delicious,” “healthy,” chemically produced processing aids, which would become standard. In fact, when bread first became a commodity, white bread was always trendier than browner bread. It’s a class thing: historically, white bread was traditionally for rich people because it was thought to demonstrate the “cleanliness” and “purity” of the flour. This fallacy was reproduced with industrial bread production, and so shitty industrial white flour started to flood the market. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">3.</span>

                    Bread is no longer alive; it has become a machine, just like the baker.

                     In bread factories, flours only need two hours to become bread, rather than the typical twenty-four. Like most of the food we consume in the West, bread became rationalized. And hyper-leavened, innutritious, high-glycemic-index white bread took over supermarket shelves. Efficiency above all else, at the cost of quality, respect, and pleasure.

                    The law established a strict definition for what it means to be an “artisan” baker. To claim this title, bakers have to perform the entire bread-making process from kneading to baking, using selected raw materials, at a brick and mortar establishment, and without in-process freezing. While the rest of Europe saw many of its traditional bakeries close in the face of aggressive supermarket chains, France sought to save its bakers, while also using the romantic image of the baguette (especially paired with French cheese and wine) to attract mass tourism. The campaign was successful on its surface, as 95 percent of French consumers now buy their bread from artisanal bakeries. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span>

                    This would be a beautiful story about successful state intervention if, twenty-five years later, I could go the artisanal bakery around the corner and eat delicious, healthy bread. But, as is often the case with state intervention, the public was misled—including at least one disillusioned Australian blogger living in France. The story of institutionalizing “artisan” bread production in France is really the story of corporate recuperation and consolidation.This new requirement systematizes the learning of “traditional” bread making recipes that rely exclusively on chemical yeast and near-white flours. As a result, many artisan bakers wake up in the middle of the night to combine water and ready-made mixes, breathing in industrial flour and baking improvers that trigger asthma and pollute their lungs—all to make second-rate bread that does nothing for the health of those who eat it. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">5.</span>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Now there is a new player in the “artisan” bread game. Let’s call it the “bobo” (bourgeois bohemian) baker: typically a former white-collar worker who left the corporate world in search of more meaningful work. Bobo bakers are behind the growth in organic sourdough bakeries. They are fond of greening capitalism but are sometimes blind to class and social struggle—which is one reason why they can sell a one-kilogram loaf for as much as fourteen euros in Paris. It is good bread made with good flour, and it tastes great if you can afford it. (Admittedly, this picture is a bit exaggerated—I unashamedly hold the greenwashed capitalist system responsible for this situation, not the workers who comprise it, save for a few.) Some of these bobo bakers have themselves been exploited my even more aggressive and cynical bread entrepreneurs. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">6.</span>

                <div class="bodycopy">
                    Another lucrative branch of “eat-healthy” capitalism is the gluten-free bread industry. What’s ironic about the gluten-free market is that it offers a solution to a problem created by food industrialization in the first place. As mentioned earlier, it is precisely the over-consumption of industrial bread (and other industrial products) that has created a huge population of people who are unable to digest it. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">7.</span>

                    If you love bread but hate agribusiness and monoculturization, what are you to do? I started to find answers to this question when I got involved a year ago with a Francophone bakers’ network called the Internationale Boulangère Mobilisée (Mobilized Bakers’ International, IBM). It is not a collective; it does not have a common charter. I can only speak about my own understanding of us because this “us” is still in the making. IBM is composed of whoever wants to join—from those who bake at home, to mobile bakers with DIY wood-fired ovens, to semi-large-scale paysannes-boulangères (peasant bakers) who make bread from wheat they grow themselves and legally sell it. <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">8.</span>

                    We all believe that bread is political, though we may not all agree on the exact political form it takes. We all try to integrate bread into our lifestyle, work, and relationships, if in different ways. I have found a network of companions and deep relationships—friends to call and visit and make bread with. I have grown hopeful that the seemingly little things we do can become powerful when done together. I have learned that anyone anywhere can make good bread, for everyone and not just for those who can pay. I have realized that a political loaf always tastes good, always fills the stomach with good stuff, even if it sometimes looks flat or lacks the sheen of supermarket bread. This is not because breadmaking, collective or otherwise, is by itself going to change the contemporary food system, but because together we have the power to create imaginaries of work and relationships that do not conform to the dominant paradigm of production.<br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">9.</span>
